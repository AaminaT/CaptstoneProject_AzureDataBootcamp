# CaptstoneProject_AzureDataBootcamp

Through the course of ZyberTech's 3-month Data Bootcamp, I have developed key skills in cloud computing and data engineering. I have understood the role of a data engineer and became familiar with the Azure environment. The tools I am familiar with include: Databricks, Data Factory, SQL Server, SQL Databases, Data Studio, DevOps, and Data Lake Storage. I have acquired knowledge and applied ETL pipelines, developed data models, and practiced my knowledge of SQL and Python. Through my project, I also picked up a little Scala to develop the calendar dimension table.

Note: Please download the .HTML version to view my code from Databricks, along with the data frames. Please feel free to import the notebook for your data analysis. My data model focuses on the order level granularity. For future exploration, an analysis can be done on product and seller information.
