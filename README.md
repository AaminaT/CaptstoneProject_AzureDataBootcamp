# CaptstoneProject_AzureDataBootcamp

Through the course of ZyberTech's 3-month Data Bootcamp, I have developed key skills in cloud computing and data engineering. I have understood the role of a data engineer and became familiar with the Azure environment. The tools I am familiar with include Databricks, Data Factory, SQL Server, SQL Databases, Data Studio, DevOps, and Data Lake Storage. I have acquired knowledge and applied ETL pipelines, developed data models, and practiced my knowledge of SQL and Python. Through my project, I also picked up a little Scala to develop the calendar dimension table.

Note: Please download the .HTML version to view my code from Databricks, along with the data frames. Please feel free to import the notebook for your data analysis. My data model focuses on the order level granularity. For future exploration, an analysis can be done on product and seller information.

## 1. Develop a Project Plan

Once the boot camp started, I developed a project plan on Workday to organize the tasks I needed to complete, along with an estimated time frame. This kept me accountable and helped me meet deadlines. The Olist dataset on Kaggle intrigued me because it was real data from a company in Brazil. Since I am interested in eCommerce data, I thought this would be a good challenge.
